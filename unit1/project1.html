  <h1>Favorite things</h1>
  <p>Hi my name is Roxy! My owner thought it would be a <strong>great</strong> idea to make me a website on my favorite things. Even though I love him dearly I told him not to put himself down. He <em>already</em> has a big head just by teaching me new tricks</p>

  <h3>Favorite Foods and Treats</h3>
  <p>I don't always like eating things especially if I'm nervous or have an upset stomach. So I need the best and since I'm daddy's little girl I get the best. My food is all human grade if dad can help it, though since we live with my grandparents they said he can't make me homemade liver treats cause it stinks up the house to much... those meanies! Here is a list of my food. I know my dad loves me due to  how much he spends ever two weeks just for my food!</p>

    <li>Liver treats</li>
