  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Pitbulls like many other breeds were specifically breed for a specific purprose. Sadly they were breed and selected over hundreds of years to be a fighting dog. Much like the Rat Terrier was breed to go into holes in the ground to hunt rats. Pitbulls were bred to be gladiators against other animals in a deadly duel to the death. Training &gt; breeding in the sense that if you have a shy dog, yes they will be shy regardless but they wont fear things too much so long as you train them and show them. </p>
