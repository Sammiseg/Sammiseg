   <p>Pitbulls are known by different things in todays world. From vicious beasts to the sweetest dogs on the earth. I am going to share my opinion on top of some facts about the pitbull so you can get an understanding of both sides.</p>

   <h3>My Look at the pitbull</h3>
   <p>Pitbulls have been breed for different things over the years. If you took a look at the other links you will know some of what I am going to be covering here. Yes, animals in general are dangerous especially if you are taking in a wolf of some kind. You are understanding that this is a wild animal not just some pet that was bred over the centuries to be mans best friend. </p>
   <p>Some people out there are scared of pitbulls. One should not be scared of an anima, one should respect the animal for their ability to protect and defend. Fearing an animal for doing what it was made or trained to do is basically fearing the world for rotating. Pitbulls yes some have been specifically selected to have certain traits like aggression or strength to be put to making the ultimate fighting dog while others have been breed to be a loving and relaxed dog that will protect your child or even you with their lives. What is the point in owning an animal if you become scared of some of the roads it can go down?</p>
   <h3>Why <strong>PEOPLE</strong> should be banned and <strong>NOT</strong> Pitbulls</h3>
   <p>Dog's are <strong>TRAINED</strong> to do half the things they do. You want a protection dog? Well most of the dog population won't know how to specifically do it until trained. You want a service dog you got to train it. Not every dog in a dog breed is cut out to be a protection or service dog (they are two different things not the same). Pitbulls by nature are not aggressive they have to be trained or specifically bred with that qualitity in order to get a dog capable of killing someone or thing.</p>
